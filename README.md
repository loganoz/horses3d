## Synopsis

**HORSES3D** is a multiphysics environment where the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, the Cahn–Hilliard equation and entropy–stable variants are solved. Arbitrary high–order, p–anisotropic discretisations are used, including static and dynamic p–adaptation methods (feature-based and truncation error-based). Explicit and implicit time-steppers for steady and time-marching solutions are available, including efficient multigrid and preconditioners. Numerical and analytical Jacobian computations with a coloring algorithm have been implemented. Multiphase flows are solved using a diffuse interface model: Navier–Stokes/Cahn–Hilliard. Turbulent models implemented include RANS: Spalart-Allmaras and LES: Smagorinsky, Wale, Vreman; including wall models. Immersed boundary methods can be used, to avoid creating body fitted meshes. Acoustic propagation can be computed using Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings models.

HORSES3D supports curvilinear, hexahedral, conforming meshes in GMSH, HDF5 and SpecMesh/HOHQMesh format. A hybrid CPU-based parallelisation strategy (shared and distributed memory) with OpenMP and MPI is followed.


## External libraries

The following external routines/libraries can be used with **HORSES3D**, but are not necessary: METIS, MPI, HDF5, MKL, PETSc.


## Compilers and third-party software

**HORSES3D** is an object-oriented Fortran 2008 solver, that can be compiled using gcc and the Intel compiler, in Unix-based operating systems.

- We recommend using recent versions of such compilers (2019 or newer).

- Make is necessary (e.g., Gnu's version, which is included in most linux distributions).

- Supported meshes are in GMSH, HDF5 (HOPR) and SpecMesh/HOHQMesh format.

- Post processing can be performed in tecplot or paraview.


## Compiling & Running

1. Go to the Solver folder and configure the project

    ```shell
    cd Solver
    ./configure
    ```

2. Build the solvers using `make` (see manual in the `/doc` folder)

    ```shell
    make clean
    make all [options]
    ```

    with the desired *options* (defaults are bold):

    - PLATFORM=MACOSX/**LINUX**

    - MODE=DEBUG/**RELEASE**

    - COMPILER=ifort/**gfortran**

    - COMM=PARALLEL/**SEQUENTIAL**

    - ENABLE_THREADS=NO/**YES**

    - WITH_PETSC=YES/**NO**

    - WITH_METIS=YES/**NO**

    - WITH_HDF5=YES/**NO**

    - WITH_MKL=YES/**NO**

    For example:

    ```shell
    make all COMPILER=ifort COMM=PARALLEL
    ```

3. Run the solver for the parameter file *file.control* (see manual in the `/doc` folder and examples in `/test`)

    ```shell
    ./horses3d.ns file.control
    ```

4. Test cases for various physics are provided in the folder `/test`
