The p-adaptation methods are used when the p-adaptation region is specified in the control file. There are two different types of p-adaptation algorithms: A Truncation Error (TE) algorithm and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm.

## Reinforcement Learning p-Adaptation

This algorithm can perform a p-adaptation based on a trained RL agent.

```Markdown
#define p-adaptation
   adaptation type       = RL
   agent file            = policy_padaptation/p_adaptation_policy
   tolerance             = 1d-2
   Nmax                  = [6, 6, 2]
   Nmin                  = [2, 2, 2]
   Conforming boundaries = [cylinder]
   restart files         = .FALSE.
   mode                  = iteration
   interval              = 10
   threshold             = 2.0
#end
```

## Multiple truncation error estimations 
<a name="MultiTau"></a>

When using Truncation Error based adaptation, a static p-adaptation procedure can be driven by a set of error estimations, which have to be performed beforehand in a simulation with the following block:

```Markdown
#define multi tau-estimation
   truncation error type = isolated
   interval              = 10
   folder                = MultiTau
#end
```
