title: Immersed Boundary Method



The immersed boundary is activated during the simulation if the following lines are specified in the control file:

```markdown
#define IBM
   name                           = myIBM
   active                         = .true.
   penalization                   = 1.0d-6
   semi implicit                  = .false.
   number of objects              = 5 
   number of interpolation points = 15
   band region                    = .true.
   band region coefficient        = 1.3
   compute distance               = .true.
   clip axis                      =  1
   aab                            = .false.
   describe                       = .true.
   plot obb                       = .false.
   plot kdtree                    = .false.
   plot mask                      = .true.
   plot band points               = .false.
#end
```

A folder called 'IBM' must be created.

## STL file

Immersed boundary requires, along with the mesh, a STL file. It must be put in the MESH folder with the mesh. The STL file name must be in lowercase character. In some programs, like AutoCAD, a STL file has always positive coordinates: the mesh should be built according to this consideration.
In the case of 2D simulations, the STL can be automatically cut by `horses3D` through the addition of the line *clip axis* (described in the previous section) so that only the STL portions inside the mesh are considered.

| stl file name =      | *CHARACTER*: The name of the STL file, without extension; it has to be inside the folder "MESH". | **Mandatory keyword** |
| stl file nameN =     | *CHARACTER*: The name of the \(\mathrm{N}^{th}\)-STL file (where N starts from 2), without extension; for the first STL just use "stl file name". It has to be inside the folder "MESH". | none                |


## Computing forces

In order to compute the forces on a body, the monitor should be defined as usual but the "Marker=" has to be equal to the name of the stl file on which the user wants to compute the forces. Given a STL file called "stlname", the monitor should be:

```markdown
#define surface monitor 1
   marker = stlname
   .
   .
   .
#end
```

The result of this operation is a `.tec` file inside the RESULTS folder. This file contains a scalar or a vector data projected on the body surface. 

## Moving bodies

If one or more of the stl files move, then the following lines must be added:

```markdown
#define stl motion 1
   stl name         = mySTL
   type             = rotation 
   angular velocity = 134.5d0
   motion axis      = 2
#end
\end{lstlisting}
```
